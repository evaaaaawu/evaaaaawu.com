Semantic HTML means developing with HTML tags that convey meaning, such as the `<form>` tag or the `<table>` tag.

Currently, there are over 100 semantic tags. For a complete list of tags, refer to [HTML elements reference - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)

We can see that these tags clearly define their content. The purpose of this approach is to improve SEO, enhance code readability, and increase accessibility, making it easier for other devices (such as screen readers) to parse the content.
