Semantic HTML means developing with HTML tags that convey meaning, such as the `<form>` tag or the `<table>` tag. Unlike generic containers like `<div>` or `<span>`, semantic elements clearly indicate their purpose and the type of content they contain.

Currently, there are over 100 semantic tags. For a complete list of tags, refer to [HTML elements reference - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

These semantic tags make your code more meaningful to browsers, developers, and assistive technologies. This approach improves SEO, enhances code readability, and increases accessibility, making it easier for other devices (such as screen readers) to properly interpret and present the content.
