null can be understood as "nothing," representing an empty value for a variable.

undefined can be understood as "not yet," indicating that a value has not been defined. So if you declare a variable but haven't assigned a value to it, you'll get undefined.

undeclared refers to something that has never been declared. When you try to use a variable that hasn't been declared, you'll get a ReferenceError, which indicates an undeclared state.
