JavaScript has three distinct ways to represent missing values. Understanding their differences is important for debugging and writing reliable code.

**null** can be understood as "nothing," representing an empty value for a variable.

```javascript
let emptyValue = null; // explicitly set to empty
```

**undefined** can be understood as "not yet," indicating that a value has not been defined. For example, if you declare a variable but haven't assigned a value to it, you'll get undefined.

```javascript
let unassignedValue; // value is undefined
console.log(unassignedValue); // undefined
```

**undeclared** can be understood as "never existed," referring to something that has never been declared. When you try to use a variable that hasn't been declared, you'll get a ReferenceError.

```javascript
console.log(nonExistentVariable); // throws ReferenceError: nonExistentVariable is not defined
```
