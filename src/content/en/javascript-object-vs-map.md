Map was introduced in ES6, while Object was traditionally used as a Map before ES6. The newly introduced Map has several key differences compared to the original Object:

## Map Advantages

### Map has no prototype, making it safer and preventing accidental key naming conflicts

- Map is more secure: When setting user-provided key-value pairs with an Object, attackers could potentially overwrite the Object's prototype, leading to object injection attacks.

- Map prevents accidental key naming conflicts: With Objects, you need to be cautious about default keys that might conflict with your custom keys.

- Note: While these issues can be resolved using `Object.create(null)`, this approach is rarely used in practice.

### Map keys can be any value, while Object keys are limited to String or Symbol

Map prevents accidental naming conflicts caused by automatic key conversion to String: When working with key-value pairs, developers often use various data types as keys. However, in JavaScript, when using Objects, any key is automatically converted to a string, which can lead to errors. For example, two originally different keys might become identical strings after conversion, resulting in key collision issues. Map objects solve this problem by allowing developers to use any value as a key.

### Map supports iteration

We can directly iterate over a Map using `for...of` or `forEach`, while iterating over an Object requires additional methods like `Object.entries` or `Object.keys`.

### Map keys maintain insertion order

As mentioned above, Map is iterable and maintains the order of elements during iteration. When using Objects, even with helper methods like `Object.entries` or `Object.keys`, the iteration results might not follow the original insertion order. This ordered behavior makes Map objects particularly useful in algorithms where maintaining order is crucial.

### Map provides convenient methods for key-value pair operations

For example, Map has a simple `size` method to determine the number of key-value pairs, while with Objects, we need to use `Object.keys().length`. Additionally, Map provides a `clear` method to remove all key-value pairs at once, whereas with Objects, you would need to delete them individually.

### Map performs better for frequent key-value pair modifications

Map is optimized for scenarios requiring efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.

## Map Disadvantages

### Map lacks native support for serialization and parsing

Objects can be serialized and parsed using `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()` respectively, but Map requires custom implementation for these operations.
