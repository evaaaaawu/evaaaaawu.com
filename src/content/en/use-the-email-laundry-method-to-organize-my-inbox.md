I tried using the email laundry method from the book "[Uptime](https://www.amazon.com/Uptime-Practical-Personal-Productivity-Wellbeing/dp/0063317443)" to organize my Gmail, and the moment I finished organizing it, I truly felt mentally and physically refreshed.

Keeping the inbox empty is incredibly refreshing.

Additionally, I've recently been canceling subscriptions to many newsletters, developing a habit of immediately unsubscribing if there are promotional emails that aren't important to me or if I find myself never clicking on, or no longer having the mental energy to open subscription content. I've found this approach to be quite effective.

I've discovered that the number of newsletter subscriptions really needs to be consciously managed. The silently increasing number of unread messages in your inbox can unconsciously become a source of irritation and pressure.

When you're subscribed to too much content, there's simply no energy to read all the emailsâ€”to the point where you eventually don't even want to open and read the truly important ones. It feels really good to only keep an appropriate amount of valuable content, and now I finally have more motivation to open my inbox to read and process emails.
