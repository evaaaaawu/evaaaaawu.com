In JavaScript, the value of `this` is dynamic and typically determined by how a function is called. This means that what affects the value of `this` is not when it's declared, but where it's invoked.

There are 5 ways to determine the value of `this`:

1. In a regular function call, `this` refers to the global object (the `Window` object in browsers in non-strict mode, or `undefined` in strict mode).

2. When a function is called as a method of an object, `this` refers to that object.

3. When a function is called with the `new` keyword, a new object is created before the function executes, and `this` refers to this newly created object.

4. We can also use the `apply`, `call`, and `bind` methods to explicitly specify which object `this` should refer to.

5. Arrow functions, introduced in ES6, don't have their own `this` value. Instead, they inherit `this` from the nearest outer function. If that outer function is also an arrow function, it will continue looking up the scope chain. This process continues until it finds the default `this` value in the global environment (e.g., `window` in browsers).
